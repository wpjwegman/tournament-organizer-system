# **Backend Architecture - MongoDB Design Decisions**

## **Overview**

The Tournament Organizer backend is designed as a collection of independent REST APIs, each serving a specific domain.
This document explains the key architectural decisions and their benefits.

## **MongoDB Document Design**

### **Hierarchical Data Model**

The system uses MongoDB's document model to store hierarchical data structures, providing significant performance
benefits over traditional relational databases.

#### **Benefits of Document Storage**

**1. Single Query Retrieval**

- Complete profile hierarchies can be fetched with a single database query
- Eliminates the N+1 query problem common in relational databases
- Reduces network round-trips and improves response times

**Example:**

```json
{
  "human_profile": {
    "name": { "first": "John", "last": "Doe" },
    "birth_details": { "date": "1990-05-15", "place": "Metropolis" },
    "medical_history": {
      "health_conditions": [...],
      "vaccination_records": [...],
      "allergies": [...]
    },
    "memberships": [...],
    "training_records": [...]
  }
}
```text

**2. Natural Data Relationships**

- Embedded documents reflect natural business relationships
- No need for complex joins or foreign key constraints
- Data locality improves cache performance

**3. Schema Flexibility**

- Easy to add new attributes without migration scripts
- Supports different document structures within the same collection
- Future extensions are straightforward to implement

### **Domain Independence**

Each domain is implemented as an independent REST API, providing:

**1. Independent Evolution**

- Domains can evolve independently without affecting others
- Different teams can work on different domains
- Technology choices can be optimized per domain

**2. Scalability**

- Domains can be scaled independently based on load
- Resource allocation can be optimized per domain
- Failure isolation between domains

**3. Deployment Flexibility**

- Domains can be deployed independently
- Different deployment strategies per domain
- A/B testing can be done at domain level

## **Data Model Design Principles**

### **Value Objects for Attributes**

All attribute models are implemented as Value Objects because:

**1. Business Clarity**

- Each attribute serves a specific business purpose
- Names reflect business domain concepts
- Independent evolution maintains business separation

**2. Future Flexibility**

- Attributes can evolve independently
- New domain-specific attributes can be added
- Changes don't affect unrelated attributes

**Example:**

```markdown
Sex (Value Object) - Biological classification Gender Identity (Value Object) - Personal identity Country (Value
Object) - Geographic classification
```text

Even though they have identical structures, they serve different business purposes and can evolve independently.

### **Embedded vs Referenced Data**

**Embedded Data:**

- Frequently accessed together
- Small to medium size
- Rarely updated independently
- Natural hierarchical relationships

**Referenced Data:**

- Large data sets
- Frequently updated independently
- Shared across multiple entities
- Complex relationships

## **Performance Considerations**

### **Document Size Management**

**Current Approach:**

- Monitor document sizes to stay within MongoDB's 16MB limit
- Split large attribute groups when necessary
- Use references for very large data sets

**Optimization Strategies:**

- Embed frequently accessed data
- Reference rarely accessed data
- Use aggregation pipelines for complex queries
- Implement proper indexing strategies

### **Query Optimization**

**Benefits of Document Model:**

- Single query retrieves complete hierarchies
- No complex joins required
- Natural indexing on embedded fields
- Efficient range queries on embedded arrays

**Indexing Strategy:**

- Index frequently queried fields
- Compound indexes for common query patterns
- Text indexes for search functionality
- Geospatial indexes for location-based queries

## **API Design**

### **REST API Structure**

Each domain exposes a REST API with:

**1. Resource-Based URLs**

```text
GET /api/identity/profiles/{id}
GET /api/identity/profiles/{id}/medical-history
GET /api/tournament/events/{id}/participants
```text

**2. Hierarchical Data Retrieval**

- Single endpoint returns complete profile with embedded attributes
- Optional query parameters for partial data retrieval
- Consistent response formats across domains

**3. Independent Operations**

- Each domain handles its own CRUD operations
- Cross-domain operations use domain services
- Event-driven communication for domain coordination

## **Future Considerations**

### **Schema Evolution**

**MongoDB Advantages:**

- Schema changes don't require migration scripts
- Backward compatibility is easier to maintain
- New fields can be added gradually
- Different document versions can coexist

### **Scalability Planning**

**Horizontal Scaling:**

- Sharding strategies for large collections
- Read replicas for query distribution
- Domain-specific database instances
- Microservices architecture support

### **Data Consistency**

**Eventual Consistency:**

- Acceptable for most tournament operations
- Strong consistency where required
- Saga patterns for complex transactions
- Event sourcing for audit trails

## **Conclusion**

The MongoDB document design provides significant performance benefits through:

- Single query retrieval of hierarchical data
- Natural data relationships
- Schema flexibility for future extensions
- Independent domain evolution

This architecture supports the Tournament Organizer's requirements for performance, scalability, and maintainability
while providing the flexibility needed for future growth.
