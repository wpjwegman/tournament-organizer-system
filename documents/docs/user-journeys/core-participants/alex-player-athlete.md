# My Tournament Journey: Competing Across Categories

Hi, I’m Alex! I love competing in tournaments that let me try different things. This time, I’m entering one big tournament with at least three categories: basketball, chess, and art. My scores in each category will be added up, and if I do well enough overall, I could even win the whole tournament!

## Why I Compete

I enjoy variety. Playing basketball is exciting and lets me work with a team. Chess is all about thinking ahead, and art gives me a chance to be creative. I’m glad this tournament lets me do all of them at once. It feels good to be recognized for more than just one skill.

## Finding the Right Tournament

Finding the right tournament can be tricky. I usually have to look at lots of different websites to find all the details. I wish everything was in one place, but at least the Tournament Organizer app helps me see what’s available and keeps things organized.

## Creating My Account

The first thing I did was set up my account using the [account creation process](../technical-processes/registration-process.md). It was quick and easy—I only had to enter my details once, and the system remembered them for every event.

## Registering for a Tournament and Disciplines

First, I registered for the tournament itself. Only after that could I choose which disciplines I wanted to compete in—basketball, chess, and art. Disciplines are always part of a tournament; you can't sign up for them separately. The [multi-discipline registration process](../technical-processes/registration-process.md) made this easy. The app asked me the right questions for each discipline, so I didn’t have to fill out anything extra. For basketball, I created a team and invited my friends. For chess and art, I registered as an individual. The system made it simple to handle all these different setups.


## Financial Details

Paying for the tournament was simple. I paid one fee for all the disciplines I registered for, and if a discipline didn’t have enough participants, I’d get an automatic refund for that part—no hassle. The app kept track of all payments and refunds, so I always knew where I stood financially.

## Waiting for Confirmation

After signing up, I had to wait to see if each discipline would have enough people. The app kept me updated with the [notification framework](../technical-processes/notification-framework.md), so I always knew what was happening. When chess was waitlisted, I got a message right away, and when it was approved, I could start preparing.

## Checking In

When I arrived, I used the [digital check-in system](../technical-processes/check-in-system.md) on my phone. No lines, no paperwork—just a tap and I was ready to go. The app gave me my schedule, maps, and even told me where to go for each event.


## Getting Ready for a Basketball Match

On game day, the app told me exactly when and where my basketball team was playing, and who our opponent would be. I could see the schedule for all matches, and the app even showed an "on deck" status—so when the match before ours started, I knew we were up next and could get ready. My teammates and I got reminders to warm up, and we always knew which court to go to. It made the whole experience less stressful and more fun.

## Competing in Three Disciplines

It was a busy weekend! I played basketball, submitted my art, and played chess—all without missing anything. The app made sure my disciplines didn’t overlap, and if there was a problem, it was fixed before I even noticed. I felt supported and could focus on doing my best.

## Getting Notifications and Updates

Throughout the tournament, the [notification framework](../technical-processes/notification-framework.md) kept me on track. I got reminders before each game or round, and if something changed, like a chess round starting late, I got a notification right away. It felt like having a personal assistant.

## Results and What I Learned

After the tournament, I got my results right away, thanks to the [results management system](../technical-processes/results-management.md). I could see how I did in each category, and the app even gave me tips on what to work on next. I was proud to share my achievements with my family and friends, and the app made it easy to show my progress.

## What I Like Most

- I only had to sign up once for everything.
- The app kept me informed and on time.
- I could focus on playing and having fun, not on paperwork.
- I learned a lot about myself by trying different things.

## What Could Be Better

I’d love it if the app could help me find even more tournaments in the future, and maybe give me more insights into how my skills in one category help me in another.
