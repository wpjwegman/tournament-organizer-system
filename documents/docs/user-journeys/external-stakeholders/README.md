# External Stakeholders User Journey Documentation

## Overview

External Stakeholders represent the broader community ecosystem surrounding tournament activities. These individuals
and organizations, while not directly participating in or organizing tournaments, play crucial roles in creating
meaningful community connections, providing essential support services, and ensuring that tournaments contribute
positively to local development and family experiences.

External Stakeholders bridge the gap between tournament-specific activities and broader community impact, requiring
sophisticated coordination tools that respect both tournament operations and community needs while enabling authentic
relationship building and meaningful contribution.
