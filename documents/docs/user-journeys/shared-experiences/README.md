# Shared Experiences User Journey Documentation

## Overview

Shared Experiences represent cross-cutting user journeys that span multiple stakeholder roles within the Tournament Organizer ecosystem. These experiences are common workflows that all stakeholders encounter, but with role-specific variations and requirements that need to be documented and understood.

Unlike role-specific journeys that focus on a single stakeholder's complete experience, shared experiences demonstrate how the same fundamental process serves different stakeholder needs through intelligent adaptation and customization.

## Shared Experience Categories

### Universal Onboarding Experiences
Core system interactions that every stakeholder must complete before participating in tournament activities.

### Transaction & Process Workflows
Financial and administrative processes that involve multiple stakeholder types with different requirements and authorization levels.

### Discovery & Communication Systems
Information flow and discovery mechanisms that serve different stakeholder information needs and communication preferences.

## Documentation Approach

### Role-Specific Variations
Each shared experience documents how the core workflow adapts to serve different stakeholder needs while maintaining system consistency and integration.

### Technical Integration Points
Shared experiences identify common technical requirements and integration points that serve multiple stakeholder types efficiently.

### Business Process Documentation
These experiences provide detailed business process documentation that guides both user experience design and technical implementation across stakeholder boundaries.

### Cross-Reference Integration
Shared experiences are referenced within individual stakeholder journey stories to provide implementation detail without duplicating documentation.
