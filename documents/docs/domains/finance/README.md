# **Finance Domain**

## **Overview**

The Finance domain provides a comprehensive framework for planning, managing, and tracking all financial aspects of
tournaments and related activities. It covers budgeting, income, expenses, fees, discounts, payments, and receipts,
supporting both planned and actual financial flows.

This domain is designed for flexibility, traceability, and extensibility, enabling complex fee structures, multiple
income sources, and full auditability from budget planning to real-world transactions.

## **Domain Structure**

### **Core Models**

- **[Finance](../finance/finance.md)**: Template for tournament/discipline financial planning and

  budgeting

- \*\*\*\*: Defines specific charges for participants, teams, or registrations
- **[Expense](../finance/expense.md)**: Records financial costs with line item breakdowns
- **[Income](../finance/income.md)**: Tracks all sources of revenue with line item details
- **[Discount](../finance/discount.md)**: Template for rules and conditions for price reductions
- **[Payment](../finance/payment.md)**: Records actual payments made
- **[Receipt](../finance/receipt.md)**: Records actual receipts received
- **[Amount](../finance/amount.md)**: Value object for monetary values
- **[Item](../inventory/item.md)**: Represents individual financial items (used in line items)
- **[Cart](../finance/cart.md)**: Represents a collection of fees/items for checkout

## **Template Entity Analysis**

### **Current Template Entities**

- **Finance**: Used as a template for tournament/discipline budgets
- **Discount**: Template for reusable discount rules
- **Fee**: Can be templated for standard fee structures
- **Income/Expense**: Templates for standard revenue/cost types

### **Potential Template Entities**

- **Payment/Receipt Templates**: Standardize transaction types
- **Cart Templates**: Standardize checkout flows for different contexts

## **Status Lifecycle**

### **Finance Statuses**

- **Active**: Template is available for use
- **Deprecated**: Template is no longer recommended

### **Fee/Discount Statuses**

- **Active**: Available for application
- **Inactive**: Not currently available
- **Expired**: No longer valid (Discounts)

### **Expense/Income Statuses**

- **Draft**: Record is being created
- **Submitted**: Awaiting approval or processing
- **Approved**: Ready for payment/receipt
- **Paid/Received**: Transaction completed

### **Payment/Receipt Statuses**

- **Pending**: Awaiting processing
- **Completed**: Transaction finished
- **Failed**: Transaction did not complete

### **Lifecycle Transitions**

- Finance: Active → Deprecated
- Fee/Discount: Active ↔ Inactive → Expired (Discount)
- Expense/Income: Draft → Submitted → Approved → Paid/Received
- Payment/Receipt: Pending → Completed/Failed

## **Relationships & Cross-References**

- **Finance ↔ Tournament/Discipline**: Budget planning and management
- **Fee/Discount ↔ Registration/Cart/Line Item**: Application of charges and reductions
- **Expense/Income ↔ Item/Amount/Organization/User**: Detailed financial tracking
- **Payment/Receipt ↔ Profile/Registration/Fee**: Real-world transaction records

## **Quality Standards**

- All models include comprehensive attribute documentation
- Cross-references are accurate and up to date
- Status lifecycles are clearly defined
- Template entity usage is documented
- Practical examples are provided where relevant
- Consistent formatting and terminology throughout

## **Implementation Guidelines**

- Use template entities for standardization and efficiency
- Enforce status transitions and lifecycle rules
- Validate all financial flows for traceability and auditability
- Maintain accurate cross-references between all related models
- Regularly review and update documentation for clarity and completeness
