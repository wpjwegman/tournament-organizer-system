# **Finance** (Data Model - Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Finance** Entity represents the financial management and accounting system within the tournament organization. It
provides a comprehensive way to handle financial information for revenue tracking, expense management, and financial
reporting within the tournament system.

It manages financial characteristics and coordinates with other entities (like
[Income](../finance/income.md), [Expense](../finance/expense.md), and ) to provide complete
financial oversight.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).
