# Receipt (Entity Template)

## Introduction

A **Receipt** represents a financial inflow to the organization. Receipts are created when the organization receives
money from a profile (such as a participant), sponsor, ticket buyer, or other source. Receipts are linked to the
relevant income source, such as a fee, ticket sale, or sponsorship.

## Relationships

- Linked to the payer (profile, sponsor, organization, etc.)
- Linked to the relevant income source (fee, ticket, sponsorship, etc.) via Related Item

**Note:** The tournament is always the recipient for receipts. Only the payer (profile, sponsor, organization, etc.) is
stored explicitly. This ensures clear traceability and aligns with best practices.

## Considerations

- Receipts are for data storage only; reporting and analysis are handled elsewhere.
- Each receipt should be traceable to its origin (profile and income source).
