# Payment (Entity Template)

## Introduction

A **Payment** represents a financial outflow from the organization. Payments are created when the organization pays
money to a profile (such as a participant for a refund or prize), a vendor, or another external party. Payments are
linked to the relevant expense or payout source, such as a refund, prize, or vendor invoice.

## Relationships

- Linked to the payee (profile, vendor, organization, etc.)
- Linked to the relevant expense or payout source (refund, prize, vendor, etc.) via Related Item

**Note:** The tournament is always the source for payments. Only the payee (profile, vendor, organization, etc.) is
stored explicitly. This ensures clear traceability and aligns with best practices.

## Considerations

- Payments are for data storage only; reporting and analysis are handled elsewhere.
- Each payment should be traceable to its origin (recipient and expense/payout source).
