# **Fee** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Fee** Entity represents a charge or fee that can be applied to participants, teams, or organizations within the
tournament system. It provides a consistent way to handle fee information for pricing, billing, and financial management
within the tournament system.

It describes financial characteristics and is typically managed by [Finance](../finance/finance.md)
entities to provide complete fee oversight.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.
