# **Cart** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Cart** Entity represents a shopping cart within the tournament system. It provides a consistent way to handle cart
information for fee collection, payment processing, and transaction management within the tournament system.

It describes financial characteristics and is typically managed by [Finance](../finance/finance.md)
entities to provide complete cart oversight.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).
