# **Role** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Role** Entity Template defines a reusable blueprint for a specific function, responsibility, or position within the
tournament system. It serves as a standardized definition that can be referenced when assigning roles to participants,
staff, or other entities.

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md). When used, its
definition is typically **copied** into the target context, allowing for potential minor modifications or annotations
without altering the original template.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard role. Instance-specific variations or customizations belong on

  the copied instance within its specific context.

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context needs to be handled by

  application logic.

- **Permission Management:** Role templates should clearly define associated permissions.
- **Responsibility Assignment:** Role templates should specify associated responsibilities.
