# Role (Template Entity)

## Overview

A Role is a template entity that defines a set of responsibilities, permissions, and requirements within the tournament system. It serves as a standardized definition that can be referenced when assigning roles to participants, staff, or other entities.

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md). When used, its definition is typically **copied** into the target context, allowing for potential minor modifications or annotations without altering the original template.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## Purpose

- Define standardized roles that can be assigned throughout the tournament system
- Manage permissions and responsibilities consistently across different contexts
- Support role-based access control and authorization
- Enable flexible role assignment and customization

## Structure

This template entity includes standard attributes from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## Considerations

- **Template Nature**: This template defines a standard role. Instance-specific variations or customizations belong on the copied instance within its specific context.
- **Copy Mechanism**: The process of copying this template definition into a target context needs to be handled by application logic.
- **Permission Management**: Role templates should clearly define associated permissions.
- **Responsibility Assignment**: Role templates should specify associated responsibilities.
