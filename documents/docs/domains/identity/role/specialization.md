# Specialization (Template Entity)

## Introduction

A **Specialization** Entity Template defines a reusable blueprint for a specific variation or specialization of a role
within the tournament system. It allows for creating more specific versions of base roles, such as "Senior Referee" or
"Junior Coach".

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the
[Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md). When used, its definition is typically **copied** into the target
context, allowing for potential minor modifications or annotations without altering the original template.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Attributes**

**Note:** This Entity Template includes the standard attributes (`ID`, `Status`, `CreatedAt`, `LastUpdatedAt`) defined
in the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

| Attribute        | Description                                                          | Type       | Required | Notes / Example                                               |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**         | A descriptive name for the specialization template.                  | String     | Yes      | `"Senior"`, `"Junior"`, `"Lead"`, `"Assistant"`               |
| **Description**  | Detailed description of the specialization template and its purpose. | Text       | Yes      | `"Advanced level with additional responsibilities"`           |
| **Type**         | The type of specialization template.                                 | String     | Yes      | `"Experience"`, `"Leadership"`, `"Technical"`, `"Functional"` |
| **Requirements** | Specific requirements for this specialization template.              | Text       | Optional | `"Minimum 5 years experience"`                                |
| **Permissions**  | Additional [Permission](permission/README.md) entities specific to this specialization. | List[UUID] | Optional | References to permission entities                             |
| **Notes**        | Additional notes about the specialization template.                  | Text       | Optional | `"Requires additional certification"`                         |

## **Relationships**

- A `Specialization` Entity Template is referenced by [Role](../../foundation/base_entity.md) entities.
- A `Specialization` Entity Template may have additional entities.

### Parent Relationships

- [Role](../../foundation/base_entity.md) - Roles that can use this specialization

### Child Relationships

- - Additional permissions for this specialization

### Related Entities

- - Role assignments that may use this specialization

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard specialization. Instance-specific variations or customizations

  belong on the copied instance within its specific context.

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context needs to be handled by

  application logic.

- **Role Compatibility:** Specializations should be compatible with the roles they can be applied to.
- **Permission Inheritance:** Specializations may add permissions beyond those of the base role.
