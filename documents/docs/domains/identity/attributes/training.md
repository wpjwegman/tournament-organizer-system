# **Training** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Training** Template Entity defines a reusable blueprint for training sessions, activities, or programs that can be
offered to participants. It provides a standardized structure for training content, requirements, and assessment criteria
that can be applied across different contexts and organizations.

It provides crucial insights for:

- Skill development tracking
- Behavior modification progress
- Training program management
- Performance assessment
- Certification preparation

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard training type. Instance-specific variations or customizations

  belong on the copied instance within its specific context (e.g., a specific organization's implementation).

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context (like a specific organization)

  needs to be handled by application logic.

- **Template Management:**

- Templates should be curated and maintained by training administrators
- New templates can be added based on training standards and organizational requirements
- Templates should be reviewed periodically for effectiveness and safety

- **Subject Specificity:** Training templates should be designed with the subject type in mind (human vs. animal)
- **Flexibility:** Should allow for adaptation to different skill levels and learning styles
- **Assessment:** Include clear criteria for evaluating training template success
- **Safety:** Consider safety requirements and risk management in the design
- **Customization Balance:**

- Templates provide structure while allowing personalization
- Customizations should not break the fundamental training structure
- System should support both template-based and fully custom training
