# **Membership** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Membership** Template Entity defines a reusable blueprint for formal affiliation status types that can be offered
by organizations. It provides a standardized structure for membership types, benefits, and requirements that can be
applied across different organizations and contexts.

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.

_(For a guide on managing memberships, see the
<!-- [Membership User Guide](# ../user_guide/ (TODO: Create user guide) -->))._

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard membership type. Instance-specific variations or customizations

  belong on the copied instance within its specific context (e.g., a specific organization's implementation).

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context (like a specific organization)

  needs to be handled by application logic.

- **Template Management:**

- Templates should be curated and maintained by organizational administrators
- New templates can be added based on membership standards and organizational requirements
- Templates should be reviewed periodically for benefits and requirements

- **Lifecycle Management:** Track membership template status changes (Active, Inactive, Deprecated)
- **Historical Records:** Maintain history of template changes
- **Validation Rules:** Ensure valid requirements and benefits
- **Security:** Control access to membership template records and audit template changes
- **Customization Balance:**

- Templates provide structure while allowing personalization
- Customizations should not break the fundamental membership structure
- System should support both template-based and fully custom memberships
