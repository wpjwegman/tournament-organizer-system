# **Emergency Contact** (Data Model - Value Object)

## **Introduction**

An **Emergency Contact** is a **Value Object** representing the details of a person designated to be contacted in case
of an emergency involving the owner of the parent record.

As a Value Object, it is defined entirely by its attributes and does not have its own identity or lifecycle. It is
always **embedded** within an owning `Contact Information` Entity.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Relationships**

- An `Emergency Contact` **Value Object** has no independent identity and holds no references to other entities.
- It is always **embedded within** an owning \*\*\*\* Entity.

---

## **Considerations**

- **Embedding:** This Value Object is intended to be part of a list within the `Contact Information` entity.
- **Contact Method:** At least one contact method (`Phone` or `Email`) should be required by application logic to ensure

  the contact is reachable.

- **Privacy:** The data stored (Name, Phone, Email, Relationship) is sensitive and requires appropriate access controls

  managed by the parent `Contact Information` context.

- **Immutability:** If contact details change, the owning `Contact Information` entity should replace the entire

  embedded `Emergency Contact` object.
