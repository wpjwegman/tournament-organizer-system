# **Treatment** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Treatment** Entity Template defines a blueprint for a specific course of medical care, intervention, or management
plan designed to address [Health Condition](../health_condition.md) or manage
**[Symptoms](../../../../../first_aid/symptom.md)**. It serves as a standardized framework for documenting and
tracking medical interventions for either human or animal subjects.

It provides crucial insights for:

- Medical intervention tracking
- Treatment protocol management
- Health condition management
- Medication administration
- Medical history documentation

This template has its own identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../../../../../foundation/base_entity.md). When a treatment is administered, its
definition is applied according to the
described in the core concepts (template copying mechanism documentation pending).

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../../../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Attributes**

**Note:** This Entity Template includes the standard attributes (`ID`, `Status` [e.g., Active, Deprecated], `CreatedAt`,
`LastUpdatedAt`) defined in the [Base Entity](../../../../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Examples by Type**

### Medication Treatments

| Name                      | Description                    | Frequency         | Duration |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------- | -------- |

| Name                    | Description                          | Frequency | Duration |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------ | --------- | -------- |

## **Relationships**

- The `Treatment` **Entity Template** is used to create specific treatment instances for \***\* or \*\*** entities.
- It may be part of a broader Health Plan (future enhancement).
- It addresses specific [Health Condition](../health_condition.md) entities.
- It may involve specific [Medicine](medicine.md) entities.
- Treatment instances are typically recorded in Medical Log entities (future enhancement).

---

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** Defines a standard treatment protocol. Instance-specific details (administration times,

  responses, outcomes) belong on the copied instance or in the Medical Log.

- **Copy Mechanism:** When instantiated, creates a new treatment with its own identity.
- **Medicine Management:** References to medicines should be validated against current inventory and prescriptions.
- **Safety:** Consider safety requirements and risk management in the template design.
- **Documentation:** Clear documentation of procedures and requirements is essential.
