# **Interest** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

An **Interest** Template Entity represents a standardized interest category or hobby that can be selected and customized
by users. It provides a consistent way to handle interest information for participant matching, team formation, and
personalization within the tournament system.

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the
[Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md). When used, its definition is typically **copied** into the target
context (like a specific human profile), allowing for potential minor modifications or annotations without altering the
original template.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.

## **Attributes**

**Note:** This Template Entity includes the standard attributes (`ID`, `Status`, `CreatedAt`, `LastUpdatedAt`) defined in the [Base Entity Model](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

| Attribute       | Description                                           | Type     | Required | Notes / Example                                                   |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ID**          | Unique identifier for the interest template entity.   | UUID     | Yes      | `"i123e456-7890-1234-5678-901234567890"`                          |
| **Category**    | The category of interest.                             | String   | Yes      | `"Sports"`, `"Technology"`, `"Arts"`, `"Science"`                 |
| **Name**        | The specific name of the interest.                    | String   | Yes      | `"Basketball"`, `"Programming"`, `"Painting"`, `"Physics"`        |
| **Level**       | The level of expertise or involvement.                | String   | Optional | `"Beginner"`, `"Intermediate"`, `"Expert"`                        |
| **Description** | Additional description or context about the interest. | String   | Optional | `"Competitive basketball player"`, `"Web development enthusiast"` |
| **Status**      | The status of the interest template.                  | String   | Optional | `"Active"`, `"Inactive"`, `"Deprecated"`                          |
| **Created At**  | Timestamp when the interest template was created.     | DateTime | Yes      | `"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"`                                          |
| **Updated At**  | Timestamp when the interest template was last updated.| DateTime | Yes      | `"2024-01-20T14:45:00Z"`                                          |

## **Relationships**

- **Template Relationships:**

- Interest Templates can be grouped by Category for easier discovery
- Interest Templates can be referenced by team formation algorithms for matching
- Interest Templates can be linked to [Category](../../classification/category.md) entities for organization

- **Instantiation Relationships:**

- When instantiated, Interest Templates create Interest instances embedded within

    [Human Profile](../profile/human.md) entities

- Multiple human profiles may instantiate the same Interest Template with different customizations
- Interest Templates can be referenced by [Team Formation](../../team/README.md) entities for matching

---

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard interest category. Instance-specific variations or customizations

  belong on the copied instance within its specific context (e.g., a Human Profile's implementation).

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context (like a Human Profile)

  needs to be handled by application logic.

- **Template Management:**

- Templates should be curated and maintained by system administrators
- New templates can be added based on popular interests and trends
- Templates should be reviewed periodically for relevance and accuracy

- **Categorization:** Interest templates should be properly categorized for effective discovery and matching.
- **Level Assessment:** Interest levels should be self-assessed or validated appropriately.
- **Privacy:** Interest information should be handled according to privacy preferences.
- **Matching:** Interest templates can be used for team formation and participant matching algorithms.
- **Customization Balance:**

- Templates provide structure while allowing personalization
- Customizations should not break the fundamental interest classification
- System should support both template-based and fully custom interests
