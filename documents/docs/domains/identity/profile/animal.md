# **Animal Profile** (Data Model â€“ Entity)

## **Introduction**

The **Animal Profile** Entity inherits from the [Base Profile](base_profile.md) and
represents an animal participant or resource within Tournament Organizer. It includes only the most essential
animal-specific attributes and relationships, with all context-specific roles (handler, trainer, etc.) managed elsewhere
in the system.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/README.md).
