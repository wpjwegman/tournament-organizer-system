# **Notification** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Notification** Entity represents a message or alert that can be sent to participants, organizers, or other
stakeholders within the tournament system. It provides a consistent way to handle notification information for
communication, updates, and event management within the tournament system.

It describes communication characteristics and is typically managed by communication systems to provide comprehensive
notification oversight.

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.

## **Attributes**

**Note:** This Template Entity includes the standard attributes (`ID`, `Status`, `CreatedAt`, `LastUpdatedAt`) defined in the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

| Attribute        | Description                                               | Type      | Required | Notes / Example                                      |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Type**         | The type of notification.                                 | String    | Yes      | `"Email"`, `"SMS"`, `"Push"`, `"In-App"`             |
| **Title**        | The title or subject of the notification.                 | String    | Yes      | `"Tournament Update"`, `"Registration Confirmation"` |

| **Priority**     | The priority level of the notification.                   | String    | Optional | `"Low"`, `"Normal"`, `"High"`, `"Urgent"`            |
| **Scheduled At** | The scheduled time for sending the notification.          | DateTime  | Optional | `"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"`                             |
| **Sent At**      | The time when the notification was sent.                  | DateTime  | Optional | `"2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"`                             |

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard notification type. Instance-specific variations or customizations

  belong on the copied instance within its specific context (e.g., a specific tournament's implementation).

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context (like a specific tournament)

  needs to be handled by application logic.

- **Template Management:**
  - Templates should be curated and maintained by communication administrators
  - New templates can be added based on notification standards and organizational requirements
  - Templates should be reviewed periodically for clarity and effectiveness
- **Timing:** Notifications should be sent at appropriate times for recipients.
- **Relevance:** Notifications should be relevant to the recipient's role and interests.
- **Frequency:** Notification frequency should not overwhelm recipients.
- **Privacy:** Notification content should respect privacy considerations.
- **Delivery:** Notification delivery should be reliable and trackable.
- **Customization Balance:**
  - Templates provide structure while allowing personalization
  - Customizations should not break the fundamental notification structure
  - System should support both template-based and fully custom notifications
