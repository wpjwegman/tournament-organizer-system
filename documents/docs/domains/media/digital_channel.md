# **Digital Channel** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Digital Channel** Entity represents a digital communication channel (email, SMS, social media, etc.) within the
tournament system. It provides a consistent way to handle channel information for communication management, notification
delivery, and outreach within the tournament system.

It describes communication characteristics and is typically managed by communication systems to provide comprehensive
channel oversight.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.
