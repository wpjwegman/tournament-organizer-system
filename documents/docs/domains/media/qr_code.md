# **QR Code** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **QR Code** Entity represents a Quick Response code that can be scanned to provide quick access to information or
actions within the tournament system. QR codes can be used for various purposes such as registration, check-in, access
control, or information sharing.

As an Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.
