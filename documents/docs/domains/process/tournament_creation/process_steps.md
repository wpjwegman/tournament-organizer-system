# Tournament Creation Process Steps

## Overview

This document details the step-by-step workflow for the Tournament Creation Process, providing specific
procedures, decision points, and validation requirements for each phase of tournament establishment.

## Process Workflow

### Step 1: Process Initiation

**Trigger**: Organization or authorized user requests new tournament creation

5. Generate unique Process ID

**Outputs**:

- Tournament Creation Process record
- Initial audit log entry
- Process status notification

**Validation Checks**:

- Creator has tournament creation permissions for the organization
- Organization is active and in good standing
- No duplicate tournament creation requests in progress

**Recovery Point**: Process can be cancelled or restarted from this point

3. Capture template selection decision
4. Update process status to `"Template_Selected"`
5. Log template selection in audit trail

**Outputs**:

- Selected tournament template reference
- Template configuration baseline
- Updated process status

**Validation Checks**:

- Selected template is active and available
- Template is compatible with organization type
- Template meets minimum system requirements

**Recovery Point**: Process can return to template selection or restart from initiation

- User customization preferences

**Actions**:

1. Load template default configuration
2. Present configuration interface with template parameters
3. Apply organization-specific defaults and constraints
4. Capture custom configuration values
5. Validate configuration completeness and consistency
6. Update process status to `"Customizing"`
7. Store configuration data in process record

**Outputs**:

- Complete tournament configuration data
- Configuration validation results
- Updated process status and audit log

**Validation Checks**:

- All required configuration fields are completed
- Configuration values meet business rule constraints
- No conflicts with organization policies
- Resource requirements are feasible

**Recovery Point**: Process can return to basic configuration with saved partial data

### Step 4: Venue Assignment

**Trigger**: Basic configuration validation passes

**Inputs**:

- Tournament configuration requirements
- Venue availability data
- Organization venue preferences

**Actions**:

1. Query venue availability based on tournament requirements
2. Present available venue options with capacity and feature matching
3. Capture venue selection and reservation requests
4. Validate venue availability and compatibility
5. Create preliminary venue reservations
6. Update process with venue assignment data
7. Log venue assignment decisions

**Outputs**:

- Venue assignment records
- Preliminary reservation confirmations
- Updated configuration with venue details

**Validation Checks**:

- Selected venues meet tournament capacity requirements
- Venue features support tournament configuration
- No scheduling conflicts with existing reservations
- Venue availability covers full tournament duration

**Recovery Point**: Process can return to venue assignment with preserved configuration

---

### Step 5: Schedule Setup

**Trigger**: Venue assignment completed successfully

**Inputs**:

- Tournament configuration and format
- Venue availability and constraints
- Organization scheduling preferences

**Actions**:

1. Generate preliminary tournament schedule based on configuration
2. Apply venue constraints and availability windows
3. Optimize schedule for resource utilization and participant convenience
4. Present schedule preview for review and adjustment
5. Capture schedule approval or modification requests
6. Validate schedule feasibility and compliance
7. Finalize preliminary schedule

**Outputs**:

- Complete tournament schedule
- Schedule validation results
- Resource allocation plan

**Validation Checks**:

- Schedule respects venue availability constraints
- Adequate time between matches for setup and breakdown
- Schedule meets tournament format requirements
- No conflicts with organization calendar

**Recovery Point**: Process can return to schedule setup with preserved venue assignments

---

### Step 6: Final Review and Validation

**Trigger**: Schedule setup completed successfully

**Inputs**:

- Complete tournament configuration
- Venue assignments and schedule
- Organization approval requirements

**Actions**:

1. Compile complete tournament configuration summary
2. Run comprehensive validation checks across all components
3. Generate tournament preview and impact analysis
4. Present complete package for final review
5. Route for organizational approval if required
6. Capture final approval decisions
7. Update process status to `"Validating"` or `"Approved"`

**Outputs**:

- Complete tournament specification
- Validation report
- Approval status and approver information

**Validation Checks**:

- All tournament components are consistent and complete
- Configuration meets all business rules and constraints
- Resource requirements are confirmed and available
- Approval workflow is completed if required

**Recovery Point**: Process can return to any previous step for corrections

---

### Step 7: Tournament Finalization

**Trigger**: Final validation and approval completed

**Inputs**:

- Approved tournament configuration
- Confirmed venue and schedule assignments
- Process completion authorization

**Actions**:

1. Create official Tournament record from process configuration
2. Confirm all venue reservations and resource allocations
3. Initialize tournament registration and management systems
4. Generate tournament announcement and communication materials
5. Update process status to `"Completed"`
6. Close Tournament Creation Process with success status
7. Archive process data for audit and reference

**Outputs**:

- Official Tournament record
- Confirmed reservations and allocations
- Tournament ready for registration phase
- Completed process audit trail

**Validation Checks**:

- Tournament record creation successful
- All system integrations completed
- Resource confirmations received
- Process closure properly documented

**Recovery Point**: Process completion is final; tournament modifications require separate processes

## Error Handling and Recovery

### Common Error Scenarios

1. **Venue Unavailability**: Return to venue assignment step with updated availability data
2. **Configuration Conflicts**: Return to basic configuration with specific error guidance
3. **Approval Rejection**: Return to final review with rejection comments and required changes
4. **System Failures**: Preserve process state and allow resumption from last completed step

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Automatic Recovery**: System attempts automatic recovery for transient errors
2. **Manual Intervention**: Process can be manually resumed by authorized personnel
3. **Rollback Options**: Process can be rolled back to any previous completed step
4. **Data Preservation**: All configuration and decision data is preserved during recovery

### Escalation Matrix
