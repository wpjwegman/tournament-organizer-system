#### Step 4: Conflict Detection and Resolution

**Objective**: Identify and resolve resource allocation conflicts

**Procedure**:

1. **Automated Conflict Detection**
   - Run conflict detection algorithms on preliminary allocation
   - Identify double-bookings and over-allocation scenarios
   - Detect qualification mismatches and compliance violations
   - Flag timing conflicts and logistics impossibilities

2. **Conflict Prioritization**
   - Categorize conflicts by severity and impact level
   - Assess resolution complexity and time requirements
   - Prioritize based on tournament criticality
   - Document dependencies between conflicts

3. **Systematic Conflict Resolution**
   - Apply resolution algorithms for standard conflict types
   - Escalate complex conflicts to human decision makers
   - Generate alternative allocation scenarios
   - Validate resolution impact on overall allocation quality

**Conflict Types and Resolutions**:

- **Equipment Double-booking**: Reallocate alternative equipment or adjust scheduling
- **Staff Over-assignment**: Redistribute workload or engage additional personnel
- **Venue Conflicts**: Modify space allocation or adjust event timing
- **Qualification Mismatches**: Reassign qualified personnel or provide training

**Output**: Conflict-free allocation plan with resolution documentation

### Phase 3: Allocation Implementation and Monitoring

#### Step 5: Allocation Plan Deployment

**Objective**: Implement the finalized resource allocation plan

**Procedure**:

1. **System Updates and Notifications**
   - Update resource management systems with final allocations
   - Generate personnel assignment notifications and schedules
   - Create equipment deployment and setup schedules
   - Update venue booking and configuration systems

2. **Stakeholder Communication**
   - Notify assigned personnel of roles, schedules, and locations
   - Communicate equipment deployment plans to logistics teams
   - Inform venue managers of space allocations and requirements
   - Distribute allocation summaries to tournament management

3. **Implementation Validation**
   - Verify all system updates were applied correctly
   - Confirm receipt of notifications by all stakeholders
   - Validate integration with dependent systems
   - Conduct pre-deployment readiness checks

**Output**: Deployed allocation plan with confirmation of implementation

**Quality Assurance**:

- All stakeholders confirmed receipt of allocation information
- Resource management systems reflect current allocations
- No implementation conflicts detected in validation checks
- Backup procedures are in place for critical resource failures
