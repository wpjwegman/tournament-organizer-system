# Process Domain

## Overview

The Process domain manages workflow operations and procedural activities within the Tournament Organizer system.
It provides comprehensive frameworks for role assignments, process tracking, and context-specific workflow management
across tournaments, teams, and organizational structures.

This domain focuses on the dynamic aspects of tournament operations, handling the assignment and management of roles
to participants within various contexts and ensuring proper workflow execution throughout the tournament lifecycle.

## Domain Structure

- **[Role Assignment](role_assignment.md)**: Template Entity for managing role-participant relationships within
  specific contexts (tournaments, teams, organizations)

### Supporting Integration

- **[Organization Domain](../organization/README.md)**: Organizational context for role assignments
