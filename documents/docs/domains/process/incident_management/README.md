# Incident Management Process

## Overview

The Incident Management Process provides systematic handling of issues, disruptions, and emergencies that occur
during tournament operations. This process ensures rapid response, proper escalation, and comprehensive
documentation for operational continuity and risk management.

## Purpose

- **Issue Reporting**: Standardized incident capture and classification system
- **Escalation Management**: Structured escalation paths based on incident severity
- **Resolution Tracking**: Comprehensive monitoring of incident resolution progress
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactive risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- **Compliance Documentation**: Complete audit trail for regulatory and insurance requirements

## Structure

This template entity includes standard attributes from the **[Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md)**
and adds the following process-specific attributes:

| **Current Status** | Current state of incident resolution | String | Yes | `"Reported"`, `"Acknowledged"`, `"Assigned"`, `"In_Progress"`, `"Escalated"`, `"Resolved"`, `"Closed"` |
| **Location** | Where the incident occurred | String | Yes | `"Court 1"`, `"Main Entrance"`, `"Parking Lot"`, `"Concession Stand"` |

| **Description** | Detailed description of the incident | Text | Yes | `"Player sustained ankle injury during second period play"` |
| **Immediate Actions** | Initial response actions taken | Array | Yes | `["Medical team dispatched", "Play suspended", "Area secured"]` |
| **Assigned Responder** | Reference to **[Registrant](../../identity/registrant.md)** handling the incident | UUID | Optional | `responder-uuid-345` |
| **Escalation Path** | Current escalation level and next steps | JSON | Optional | `{"current_level": "venue_manager", "next_level": "tournament_director", "escalation_criteria": "if_not_resolved_30min"}` |
| **Resolution Actions** | Actions taken to resolve the incident | Array | Optional | `["Medical evaluation completed", "Player transported to hospital", "Match resumed"]` |
| **Impact Assessment** | Assessment of incident impact on tournament | JSON | Optional | `{"match_delay": "15min", "schedule_impact": "minimal", "cost_estimate": 500}` |

## Example

    A[Incident Management: Player Injury] --> B[Process ID: proc-incident-uuid-123]
    A --> C[Incident ID: incident-uuid-456]
    A --> D[Reporter: Court Official Smith]
    A --> E[Type: Medical]
    A --> F[Severity: High]
    A --> G[Status: In_Progress]
    A --> H[Location: Court 1]
    A --> I[Affected Match: Lions vs Tigers]
    A --> J[Responder: Medical Team Lead]
    A --> K[Actions: Medical eval, Transport arranged]
    A --> L[Impact: 15min delay, Match resumed]
```

This example demonstrates an incident management process for a player injury during the Lions vs Tigers match.
Court Official Smith reported a high-severity medical incident on Court 1, currently being handled by the Medical
Team Lead. The process shows immediate medical evaluation and transport arrangements, with a 15-minute match delay
before resumption.
