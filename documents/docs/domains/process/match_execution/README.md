# Match Execution Process

## Overview

The Match Execution Process manages the complete workflow for conducting individual matches within tournaments.
This process encompasses pre-match setup, real-time match management, scoring, timing, and post-match procedures
with comprehensive audit trails for competition integrity.

## Purpose

- **Match Management**: Systematic execution of tournament matches from start to finish
- **Timing Control**: Precise time management and match duration tracking
- **Score Recording**: Accurate and verified score capture and validation
- **Official Coordination**: Integration with match officials and their responsibilities
- **Incident Handling**: Real-time incident management and documentation during matches
