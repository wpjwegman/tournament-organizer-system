# **Rule** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Rule** Entity defines a mandatory, enforceable requirement or prohibition within the context of a tournament, event,
or organization. Rules are referenced by the [Code of Conduct](../code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md) and
are the basis for disciplinary action if violated. Each rule is specific, actionable, and includes clear consequences
for non-compliance.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.

- **Enforceability:** Rule templates must be clear, actionable, and have defined consequences.
- **Clarity:** Avoid ambiguity in rule template language.
- **Contextualization:** Specify where and to whom the rule template applies.
