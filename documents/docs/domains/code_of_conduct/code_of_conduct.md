# **Code of Conduct** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Code of Conduct** Entity Template defines the enforceable standards and positive expectations for conduct within a
given context (e.g., Tournament, Organization). It is composed of references to ðŸš¨ **BROKEN:** ðŸš¨ **BROKEN:**
[Rule](../discipline/activity/variation/rule.md) entities (mandatory, enforceable requirements) and
[Expected Behavior](../code_of_conduct/expected_behavior.md) entities (positive standards), ensuring a
safe, respectful, and fair environment.

Guidelines, which are non-binding recommendations, are not referenced directly in the Code of Conduct but may be
provided separately.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Considerations**

- **Enforceability:** Only Rules and Expected Behaviors are referenced to ensure all standards are actionable and

  enforceable.

- **Clarity:** Guidelines are kept separate to avoid confusion between mandatory requirements and recommendations.
- **Template vs. Instance:** This model defines the _template_. The actual Code of Conduct applied to a specific context

  is created by copying this template's definition into the target context.

- **Versioning:** The `Version` attribute tracks changes to the template composition itself.
