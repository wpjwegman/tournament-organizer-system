# Code of Conduct Domain

## Overview

The Code of Conduct domain defines the models and relationships for managing behavioral standards and requirements
within the tournament system. This domain ensures a safe, respectful, and fair environment by providing clear guidelines
for participant conduct.

## Models

### 1. Code of Conduct (Template Entity)

- Defines the structure and composition of a code of conduct
- Acts as a template that can be instantiated for specific contexts (e.g., tournaments, organizations)
- References both Rules and Expected Behaviors
- Includes versioning for tracking changes to the template

### 2. Expected Behavior (Entity)

- Defines positive, aspirational standards of conduct
- Focuses on encouraging good behavior rather than prohibiting bad behavior
- Includes examples and rationale for each behavior
- Can be categorized and contextualized for different scenarios

### 3. Rule (Entity)

- Defines mandatory, enforceable requirements
- Includes clear consequences for violations
- Categorized by type (e.g., Safety, Fair Play, Anti-Discrimination)
- Specifies applicability and severity

## Relationships

The domain models are related as follows:

1. **Code of Conduct Template**
   - References multiple Expected Behaviors
   - References multiple Rules
   - Inherits from Base Entity for lifecycle management
   - Can be instantiated for specific contexts (Tournaments, Organizations)

2. **Expected Behavior**
   - Referenced by Code of Conduct Templates
   - Inherits from Base Entity for lifecycle management
   - Can be associated with Tournaments and Organizations

3. **Rule**
   - Referenced by Code of Conduct Templates
   - Inherits from Base Entity for lifecycle management
   - Can be associated with Tournaments and Organizations

All entities in this domain inherit from the Base Entity model, which provides standard attributes for tracking, status
management, and version control.

## Key Concepts

1. **Template-Based Approach**
   - Code of Conduct is a template entity
   - Can be instantiated for different contexts
   - Maintains version control for changes

2. **Two-Tier Standards**
   - Rules: Mandatory requirements with consequences
   - Expected Behaviors: Positive standards to encourage

3. **Lifecycle Management**
   - All entities inherit from Base Entity
   - Includes standard attributes for tracking and status management
   - Supports audit trails and version control

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Creating a Code of Conduct**
   - Start with the template
   - Select appropriate Rules and Expected Behaviors
   - Customize for specific context
   - Version appropriately

2. **Managing Rules**
   - Keep language clear and specific
   - Define concrete consequences
   - Categorize appropriately
   - Consider applicability

3. **Defining Expected Behaviors**
   - Focus on positive standards
   - Provide clear examples
   - Include rationale
   - Consider context

## Related Domains
