# Code of Conduct Domain

## Overview

The Code of Conduct domain provides standardized behavioral frameworks and enforcement mechanisms for tournament environments. It enables consistent conduct management through template-based rules, expected behaviors, and enforcement structures that can be customized for specific contexts while maintaining core standards.

## Purpose

- Enable clear, consistent behavioral standards across all tournament contexts.
- Support template-based conduct management for reuse and customization.
- Facilitate rule-based enforcement and positive behavior promotion.

## Structure

The domain consists of template entities for behavioral management and conduct enforcement:

| Entity | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) | Template defining complete behavioral frameworks with rules and expected behaviors. |
| [Expected Behavior](expected_behavior.md) | Template for positive, aspirational conduct standards that promote good behavior. |
| [Rule](rule.md) | Template for mandatory, enforceable requirements with clear consequences for violations. |
