# **Expected Behavior** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

An **Expected Behavior** Entity defines a positive, aspirational standard of conduct for participants, officials,
spectators, or other stakeholders. Expected Behaviors are referenced by the
[Code of Conduct](../code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md) to promote a safe, respectful, and inclusive
environment. They complement Rules by describing the positive actions and attitudes that are encouraged.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.

## **Attributes**

**Note:** This Template Entity includes the standard attributes (`ID`, `Status`, `CreatedAt`, `LastUpdatedAt`) defined in the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

| Attribute         | Description                                        | Type   | Required | Notes / Example                                |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------ | -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Title**         | Short, descriptive name for the expected behavior. | String | Yes      | `Sportsmanship`                                |
| **Description**   | Detailed explanation of the expected behavior.     | Text   | Yes      | `Treat all participants with respect...`       |
| **Category**      | Classification of the behavior.                    | String | No       | `Respect`, `Sportsmanship`, `Professionalism`  |
| **Applicability** | Context where the behavior applies.                | String | No       | `All Participants`, `Officials`, `Spectators`  |
| **Rationale**     | Why this behavior is important.                    | Text   | No       | `Promotes fair play and positive environment.` |

## **Relationships**

- Referenced by [Code of Conduct](../code_of_conduct/code_of_conduct.md) as a positive standard.
- May be associated with [Rule](../discipline/activity/variation/rule.md) for context.
- May be linked to specific events, matches, or participant types.

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard expected behavior type. Instance-specific variations or customizations

  belong on the copied instance within its specific context (e.g., a specific tournament's implementation).

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context (like a specific tournament)

  needs to be handled by application logic.

- **Template Management:**
  - Templates should be curated and maintained by compliance administrators
  - New templates can be added based on organizational values and cultural requirements
  - Templates should be reviewed periodically for clarity and relevance
- **Aspirational:** Expected Behavior templates describe what is encouraged, not just what is required.
- **Clarity:** Use clear, positive language in behavior templates.
- **Contextualization:** Specify where and to whom the behavior template applies.
- **Versioning:** Track changes for audit and communication.
- **Customization Balance:**
  - Templates provide structure while allowing personalization
  - Customizations should not break the fundamental behavior structure
  - System should support both template-based and fully custom expected behaviors
