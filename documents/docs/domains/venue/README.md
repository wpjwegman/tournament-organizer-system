# **Venue Domain**

## **Overview**

The Venue domain manages the physical facilities, spaces, and locations where tournament activities take place. It
provides a hierarchical structure for organizing venues, zones, and areas, along with visual mapping capabilities to
support event planning and participant navigation.

This domain uses a template-based approach where venue configurations are copied into tournaments, allowing for
tournament-specific modifications while maintaining standardized venue structures.

## **Domain Structure**

### **Core Models**

- \*\*\*\*: Template for overall physical facilities, complexes, or locations
- **[Zone](../venue/zone.md)**: Template for logical groupings or sections within larger venues
- \*\*\*\*: Template for single, specific, playable spaces where competitions occur
- **[Map](../venue/map.md)**: Template for visual representations and layouts of physical spaces

## **Template Entity Analysis**

### **Current Template Entities**

- **Venue**: Used as a template for standard venue configurations, copied into tournaments
- **Zone**: Template for organizing areas within venues, copied with venue templates
- **Area**: Template for specific playable spaces, copied with venue/zone templates
- **Map**: Template for visual layouts, can be associated with venues, zones, or areas

### **Potential Template Entities**

- **Amenity Templates**: Standard amenities available at different venue types
- **Surface Templates**: Standard surface types for different sports/activities
- **Dimension Templates**: Standard dimensions for different competition areas

## **Status Lifecycle**

### **Venue Statuses**

- **Active**: Template is available for use
- **Deprecated**: Template is no longer recommended

### **Zone Statuses**

- **Active**: Template is available for use
- **Deprecated**: Template is no longer recommended

### **Area Statuses**

- **Active**: Template is available for use
- **Deprecated**: Template is no longer recommended
- **Under Maintenance**: Area is temporarily unavailable

### **Map Statuses**

- **Active**: Map is current and available
- **Deprecated**: Map is outdated and no longer recommended

### **Lifecycle Transitions**

- Venue/Zone/Area/Map: Active → Deprecated
- Area: Active → Under Maintenance → Active

## **Relationships & Cross-References**

- **Venue ↔ Zone**: Organizes zones within venue
- **Venue ↔ Area**: Direct area references or via zones
- **Venue ↔ Map**: Overall venue layouts
- **Zone ↔ Area**: Areas within zones
- **Zone ↔ Map**: Zone-specific layouts
- **Area ↔ Map**: Area-specific layouts
- **Area ↔ Fixture**: Areas used for fixtures
- **Venue ↔ Tournament**: Venue templates copied into tournaments

## **Quality Standards**

- All models include comprehensive attribute documentation
- Cross-references are accurate and up to date
- Status lifecycles are clearly defined
- Template entity usage is documented
- Practical examples are provided where relevant
- Consistent formatting and terminology throughout

## **Implementation Guidelines**

- Use template entities for standardization and efficiency
- Enforce status transitions and lifecycle rules
- Validate venue configurations against tournament requirements
- Maintain accurate cross-references between all related models
- Regularly review and update documentation for clarity and completeness
