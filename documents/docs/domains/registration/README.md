# **Registration Domain**

## **Overview**

The Registration domain manages the formal enrollment process for participants in tournaments and events. It provides a
flexible framework for registering different types of participants (humans, animals, computers) while maintaining clear
relationships with tournaments, teams, and participant profiles.

This domain uses a polymorphic approach where registrants can be associated with different profile types, allowing for
diverse participant registration while maintaining data integrity and clear relationships.

## **Domain Structure**

### **Core Models**

- **[Registration](../registration/registration.md)**: Formal enrollment of a registrant into a tournament

  with status lifecycle

- \*\*\*\*: Individual or entity formally registered for tournaments with polymorphic profile association

### **Related Models**

- \*\*\*\*: Context-specific instance of a registrant as a player
- **[Team](../team/team.md)**: Team entities that may contain registered participants
- **[Tournament](../tournament/tournament.md)**: Tournament entities that contain registrations

## **Template Entity Analysis**

### **Current Template Entities**

- **None**: Both Registration and Registrant are instance entities

### **Potential Template Entities**

- **Registration Form Templates**: Standard registration forms for different tournament types
- **Eligibility Criteria Templates**: Standard eligibility requirements for different participant categories
- **Registration Workflow Templates**: Standard registration processes and approval workflows
- **Participant Category Templates**: Standard participant types and their registration requirements

## **Status Lifecycle**

### **Registration Statuses**

- **Pending**: Registration has been submitted but not yet confirmed
- **Confirmed**: Registration has been approved and confirmed
- **Waitlisted**: Registration is on a waiting list due to capacity limits
- **Cancelled**: Registration has been cancelled

### **Registrant Statuses**

- **Active**: Registrant is eligible and active in the system
- **Withdrawn**: Registrant has withdrawn from participation
- **Disqualified**: Registrant has been disqualified from participation
- **Banned**: Registrant has been banned from the system

### **Lifecycle Transitions**

- Registration: Pending → Confirmed/Waitlisted → Cancelled
- Registrant: Active → Withdrawn/Disqualified/Banned

## **Relationships & Cross-References**

- **Registration ↔ Tournament**: Registration is embedded within tournament
- **Registration ↔ Registrant**: Formal enrollment relationship
- **Registrant ↔ Profile**: Polymorphic association (Human, Animal, Computer profiles)
- **Registrant ↔ Team**: Potential team association through roster
- **Registrant ↔ Player**: Context-specific player instance
- **Registrant ↔ Account**: Authentication and access control
- **Registrant ↔ Contact Information**: Contact details and communication

## **Polymorphic Profile System**

### **Profile Types**

- **Human Profile**: Human participants with personal details, medical history, memberships
- **Animal Profile**: Animal participants with species, breed, owner information
- **Computer Profile**: Computer participants with technical specifications and user information

### **Profile Association**

- Registrant uses Profile Type + Profile ID for polymorphic linking
- Each profile type has specific attributes and relationships
- Profiles can be shared across multiple registrations
- Profile data is separate from registration data

## **Quality Standards**

- All models include comprehensive attribute documentation
- Cross-references are accurate and up to date
- Status lifecycles are clearly defined
- Polymorphic relationships are well-documented
- Practical examples are provided where relevant
- Consistent formatting and terminology throughout

## **Implementation Guidelines**

- Use polymorphic associations for flexible participant registration
- Enforce status transitions and lifecycle rules
- Maintain data integrity across profile types
- Ensure proper access control for sensitive profile information
- Support registration workflows and approval processes
- Maintain accurate cross-references between all related models
- Regularly review and update documentation for clarity and completeness

- \*\*\*\*: Tournament structure and management
- \*\*\*\*: Team composition and roster management
- \*\*\*\*: Profile and account management
- \*\*\*\*: Registration fees and payments
