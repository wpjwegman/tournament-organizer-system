# Business Domain Foundation Models

This directory contains the fundamental building blocks and core models that form the foundation of the business domain.
These models define the essential patterns and structures that other domain models build upon.

## Contents

### Base Entity Model

- **File:** `../../foundation/base_entity.md`
- **Purpose:** Defines the standard attributes and behaviors that every entity in the system must implement
- **Key Features:**

  - Unique ID and Template ID management
  - Version control with semantic versioning
  - Status management
  - Timestamp tracking
  - Template-Instance relationship handling

## Importance

The foundation models are crucial because they:

1. Ensure consistency across all domain models
2. Provide standardized patterns for entity management
3. Enable proper versioning and template management
4. Support robust audit trails and change tracking
5. Facilitate proper domain model evolution

## Usage

All domain models should:

1. Inherit from the base entity model
2. Follow the defined patterns and structures
3. Implement the required attributes and behaviors
4. Adhere to the versioning and template guidelines
