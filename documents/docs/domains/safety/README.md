# **Safety Domain**

## **Overview**

The Safety domain manages all aspects of safety, risk management, and incident tracking within the tournament system. It
provides comprehensive frameworks for establishing safety protocols, tracking incidents, and ensuring compliance with
safety standards across all tournament activities and venues.

This domain uses a template-based approach where safety protocols and guidelines are copied into specific contexts,
allowing for customization while maintaining standardized safety structures.

## **Domain Structure**

### **Core Models**

- **[Safety](../safety/safety.md)**: Comprehensive safety record for activities, venues, or events with

  risk assessment

- **[Incident](../safety/incident.md)**: Records of safety-related incidents, accidents, or near-misses

  for tracking and prevention

- **[Protocol](protocol/protocol.md)**: Template for creating safety protocols with guidelines and procedures
- **[Guideline](protocol/guideline.md)**: Template for specific safety instructions, recommendations, or requirements

## **Template Entity Analysis**

### **Current Template Entities**

- **Safety Protocol**: Used as a template for standard safety protocols, copied into specific contexts
- **Safety Guideline**: Template for specific safety instructions, copied into protocols or safety records
- **Safety**: Can be templated for standard safety configurations for different activities/venues

### **Potential Template Entities**

- **Incident Templates**: Standard incident types and reporting structures
- **Risk Assessment Templates**: Standard risk assessment frameworks
- **Emergency Response Templates**: Standard emergency response procedures

## **Status Lifecycle**

### **Safety Statuses**

- **Active**: Safety measures are current and in use
- **Under Review**: Safety measures are being reviewed and updated

### **Incident Statuses**

- **Reported**: Incident has been reported and documented
- **Under Investigation**: Incident is being investigated
- **Resolved**: Incident investigation and follow-up are complete

### **Safety Protocol Statuses**

- **Active**: Protocol template is available for use
- **Deprecated**: Protocol template is no longer recommended

### **Safety Guideline Statuses**

- **Active**: Guideline template is available for use
- **Deprecated**: Guideline template is no longer recommended

### **Lifecycle Transitions**

- Safety: Active ↔ Under Review
- Incident: Reported → Under Investigation → Resolved
- Safety Protocol/Guideline: Active → Deprecated

## **Relationships & Cross-References**

- **Safety ↔ Activity/Venue**: Safety measures for specific contexts
- **Safety ↔ Incident**: Incident tracking and analysis
- **Safety ↔ Emergency Contact**: Emergency contact information
- **Incident ↔ Safety/Activity/Venue**: Incident context and location
- **Incident ↔ Staff/Participant**: Affected parties and witnesses
- **Safety Protocol ↔ Safety Guideline**: Protocols contain guidelines
- **Safety Protocol ↔ Venue/Activity/Role**: Protocol context and responsibility

## **Quality Standards**

- All models include comprehensive attribute documentation
- Cross-references are accurate and up to date
- Status lifecycles are clearly defined
- Template entity usage is documented
- Practical examples are provided where relevant
- Consistent formatting and terminology throughout

## **Implementation Guidelines**

- Use template entities for standardization and efficiency
- Enforce status transitions and lifecycle rules
- Ensure timely incident reporting and documentation
- Maintain accurate cross-references between all related models
- Regularly review and update documentation for clarity and completeness
