# Safety Requirements

## Overview

Embedded safety criteria and compliance standards used throughout safety assessments and management systems.  
Defines specific requirements, thresholds, and validation rules for comprehensive safety evaluation.

## Definition

A Value Object that encapsulates safety requirements, compliance standards, and risk assessment parameters  
for consistent application across safety evaluations and management processes.

## Risk Threshold Structure

```yaml
risk_threshold:
  low: "Minimal risk, standard monitoring sufficient"
  moderate: "Elevated risk, enhanced monitoring required"
  high: "Significant risk, immediate action required"
  critical: "Severe risk, activity suspension required"
```

## Usage

Safety Requirements are embedded within:

- [Safety Assessment](safety.md) entities for specific evaluations
- [Safety System](system.md) templates for standardized requirements
- [Emergency Response](response.md) templates for response-specific criteria

## Examples

### Venue Fire Safety Requirement

```yaml
requirement_type: "venue"
category: "fire"
priority_level: "critical"
compliance_standard: "NFPA 101 Life Safety Code"
description: "Emergency exit accessibility and fire suppression system functionality"
validation_criteria:
  - "All emergency exits clearly marked and unobstructed"
  - "Fire suppression systems tested and operational"
  - "Maximum occupancy limits clearly posted"
  - "Emergency lighting systems functional"
risk_threshold:
  low: "All systems operational, clear exits, current certifications"
  moderate: "Minor system issues, temporary signage problems"
  high: "System malfunctions, blocked exits, expired certifications"
  critical: "Non-functional fire suppression, blocked emergency exits"
documentation_required: true
inspection_frequency: "monthly"
responsible_party: "Venue Safety Officer"
enforcement_method: "Certificate suspension for non-compliance"
penalty_for_non_compliance: "Immediate venue closure until compliance restored"
```

### Equipment Safety Requirement

```yaml
requirement_type: "equipment"
category: "structural"
priority_level: "high"
compliance_standard: "ANSI/ACCT Standards"
description: "Structural integrity and safe operation of tournament equipment"
validation_criteria:
  - "Equipment manufacturer certifications current"
  - "Regular inspection logs maintained"
  - "Load capacity clearly marked and respected"
  - "Safety mechanisms functional and tested"
risk_threshold:
  low: "Current certifications, recent inspections, no wear indicators"
  moderate: "Approaching inspection dates, minor wear within acceptable limits"
  high: "Overdue inspections, visible wear, safety concerns identified"
  critical: "Structural damage, safety mechanism failures, immediate danger"
documentation_required: true
inspection_frequency: "weekly"
responsible_party: "Equipment Safety Technician"
enforcement_method: "Equipment removal from service"
penalty_for_non_compliance: "Equipment quarantine until compliance restored"
```

### Personnel Medical Requirement

```yaml
requirement_type: "personnel"
category: "medical"
priority_level: "critical"
compliance_standard: "American Red Cross Standards"
description: "Qualified medical personnel availability and emergency response capability"
validation_criteria:
  - "Certified medical personnel on-site during events"
  - "Emergency medical equipment accessible and maintained"
  - "Communication systems with external emergency services"
  - "Medical incident response protocols established"
risk_threshold:
  low: "Qualified staff present, equipment ready, clear protocols"
  moderate: "Backup staff available, minor equipment issues"
  high: "Staff shortages, equipment limitations, protocol gaps"
  critical: "No qualified personnel, non-functional equipment"
documentation_required: true
inspection_frequency: "daily"
responsible_party: "Tournament Medical Director"
enforcement_method: "Event suspension until medical coverage restored"
penalty_for_non_compliance: "Immediate event cancellation if medical requirements not met"
```

## Validation Rules

1. **Priority Consistency**: Critical and high priority requirements must have documentation_required set to true
2. **Risk Threshold Completeness**: All four risk levels (low, moderate, high, critical) must be defined
3. **Validation Criteria**: Must include at least two specific, measurable criteria
4. **Compliance Standards**: Must reference recognized industry or regulatory standards
5. **Enforcement Clarity**: Enforcement methods must be specific and actionable

## Integration

Safety Requirements integrate with:

- **Safety Assessments**: Provide evaluation criteria and compliance benchmarks
- **Safety Systems**: Define standardized requirements across venue types
- **Emergency Response**: Establish response thresholds and escalation triggers
- **Risk Management**: Support risk calculation and mitigation planning

## Implementation Notes

- Requirements should be regularly reviewed and updated based on regulatory changes
- Risk thresholds must align with organizational risk tolerance
- Validation criteria should be measurable and verifiable
- Documentation requirements should support audit and compliance needs
- Integration with safety management systems should maintain requirement traceability
