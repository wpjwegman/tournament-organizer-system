## Usage

Incident Response procedures are embedded within:

- [Safety Assessment](safety.md) entities for incident tracking and resolution
- [Emergency Response](response.md) templates for coordinated response procedures
- [Safety System](system.md) templates for standardized incident handling

```

### Security Incident Response

```yaml
incident_type: "security"
severity_level: "critical"
immediate_response:
  - "Ensure personal safety of responders"
  - "Contact security personnel and law enforcement if needed"
  - "Preserve incident scene if safe to do so"
  - "Implement crowd control measures"
  - "Establish communication with tournament control"

## Validation Rules

1. **Severity Alignment**: Escalation criteria must align with incident severity level
2. **Response Timing**: Timeline requirements must be realistic and achievable
3. **Role Clarity**: Responsible roles must be clearly defined and available
4. **Documentation Completeness**: Required documentation must support incident analysis
5. **Communication Efficiency**: Notification requirements must ensure rapid information flow

## Integration

Incident Response procedures integrate with:

- **Safety Assessments**: Support incident tracking and resolution documentation
- **Emergency Response**: Provide detailed response procedures for emergency coordination
- **Safety Systems**: Establish standardized incident handling across all safety areas
- **Risk Management**: Support incident analysis and risk mitigation planning

## Implementation Notes

- Response procedures should be regularly drilled and practiced
- Timeline requirements must consider realistic response capabilities
- Documentation requirements should support legal and insurance needs
- Integration with emergency services should be pre-established
- Communication protocols should account for high-stress incident conditions
