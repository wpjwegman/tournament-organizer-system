# **Tournament Domain**

## **Overview**

The Tournament domain defines the structure, management, and lifecycle of competitive events and series of competitions
within the Tournament Organizer system. It serves as the central organizing entity that coordinates all aspects of
tournament operations, from planning and registration through execution and completion.

This domain supports various tournament formats, manages participant relationships, coordinates with venues and
schedules, and ensures proper tournament oversight and governance.

## **Domain Structure**

### **Core Models**

  of competitions

- **[Participant](../tournament/participant.md)**: Entities participating in tournaments (teams,

  individuals)

- **[Rule](../tournament/rule.md)**: Tournament-specific rules and regulations

### **Template Entity Analysis**

### **Potential Template Entities**
