# Tournament Domain

## Overview

The Tournament domain defines the structure, management, and lifecycle of competitive events and series of
competitions within the Tournament Organizer system. It serves as the central organizing domain that coordinates
all aspects of tournament operations, from planning and registration through execution and completion.

## Purpose

The Tournament domain enables comprehensive tournament management by:

- Organizing competitive events with structured formats, rules, and participant coordination across diverse sports
- Supporting various tournament formats from single elimination to round robin and league-style competitions
- Managing the complete tournament lifecycle from planning through completion and archival
- Coordinating with venues, schedules, and organizational resources for successful tournament execution
- Ensuring proper tournament oversight, governance, and compliance with established standards and regulations
- Facilitating participant registration, communication, and engagement throughout the tournament process
