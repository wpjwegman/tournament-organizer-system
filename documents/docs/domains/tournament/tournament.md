# **Tournament** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Tournament** Template Entity defines a reusable blueprint for tournament structures and configurations that can be
used to create specific tournament instances. It provides a standardized framework for tournament formats, rules, and
organizational patterns that can be applied across different contexts and organizations.

As a Template Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md), with additional template-specific attributes for versioning and reuse.

## **Template Entity Analysis**

### **Current Template Entities Used**

The Tournament entity utilizes several template entities that are copied into the tournament instance:

- \*\*\*\* - Venue templates are copied to allow tournament-specific modifications
- \*\*\*\* - Activity templates define the types of competitions
- \*\*\*\* - Discipline templates define specific competition formats
- \*\*\*\* - Organization templates for organizing bodies
- \*\*\*\* - Behavioral expectation templates
- \*\*\*\* - Safety protocol templates
- \*\*\*\* - Medical support templates

### **Potential Template Entity Candidates**

The following components could be considered for template entity status:

1. **Tournament Format Templates** - Standard tournament structures (Single Elimination, Double Elimination, Round

   Robin)

2. **Tournament Category Templates** - Standard tournament categories (Regional, National, International, Championship)
3. **Tournament Rule Set Templates** - Standard rule configurations for different types of tournaments
4. **Tournament Schedule Templates** - Standard scheduling patterns (Weekend, Multi-day, Single-day)
5. **Tournament Fee Structure Templates** - Standard fee configurations for different tournament types

### **Template Entity Benefits**

- **Consistency**: Standardized tournament configurations across similar events
- **Efficiency**: Faster tournament setup using proven templates
- **Quality**: Reduced errors through standardized structures
- **Flexibility**: Templates can be modified for tournament-specific needs
- **Maintenance**: Centralized updates to standard configurations

## **Attributes**

## **Status Lifecycle**

The Tournament entity follows the status-based data lifecycle with the following states:

### **Active States**

- **Draft**: Tournament is being planned and configured
- **Registration Open**: Tournament is accepting registrations
- **Registration Closed**: Registration period has ended
- **In Progress**: Tournament is currently running
- **Completed**: Tournament has finished

### **Inactive States**

- **Cancelled**: Tournament was cancelled before completion
- **Suspended**: Tournament is temporarily suspended
- **Archived**: Tournament is archived for historical reference

### **Status Transitions**

- **Draft → Registration Open**: Tournament is ready for registrations
- **Registration Open → Registration Closed**: Registration period ends
- **Registration Closed → In Progress**: Tournament begins
- **In Progress → Completed**: Tournament finishes successfully
- **Any Active → Cancelled**: Tournament is cancelled
- **Any Active → Suspended**: Tournament is temporarily suspended
- **Completed → Archived**: Tournament is archived after completion

## **Considerations**

- **Template Nature:** This template defines a standard tournament type. Instance-specific variations or customizations

  belong on the copied instance within its specific context (e.g., a specific organization's implementation).

- **Copy Mechanism:** The process of copying this template definition into a target context (like a specific organization)

  needs to be handled by application logic.

- **Template Management:**
  - Templates should be curated and maintained by tournament administrators
  - New templates can be added based on tournament standards and organizational requirements
  - Templates should be reviewed periodically for effectiveness and fairness
- **Planning:** Tournament templates should be planned with sufficient lead time.
- **Capacity:** Tournament template capacity should be appropriate for available resources.
- **Scheduling:** Tournament template scheduling should accommodate all participants.
- **Rules:** Tournament template rules should be clear and fair.
- **Communication:** Tournament template information should be communicated effectively to participants.
- **Customization Balance:**
  - Templates provide structure while allowing personalization
  - Customizations should not break the fundamental tournament structure
  - System should support both template-based and fully custom tournaments
