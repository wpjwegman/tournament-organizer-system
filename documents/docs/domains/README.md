## Model Guidelines

1. Each model should be self-contained and focused on a single business concept
2. Models should include clear documentation of:
   - Purpose and scope
   - Attributes and relationships
   - Business rules and constraints
   - Usage examples
3. Cross-references to related models should be maintained
4. Version history should be tracked for significant changes
