# **Member** (Data Model - Entity)

## **Introduction**

A **Member** Entity represents an individual who belongs to an organizational unit within the tournament system. It
provides a consistent way to handle membership information for organizational structure, role management, and access
control within the tournament system.

It describes organizational characteristics and is typically associated with [Unit](unit.md) entities to provide complete
membership oversight.

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Relationships**

- A `Member` Entity belongs to a [Unit](unit.md) entity.
- A `Member` Entity is associated with a entity.
- A `Member` Entity may be associated with [Role](../../foundation/base_entity.md) entities for role management.

---

## **Considerations**

- **Access Control:** Member permissions should be carefully managed.
- **Role Clarity:** Member roles should be clearly defined and understood.
- **Membership Duration:** Membership periods should be tracked and managed.
- **Permissions:** Member permissions should follow the principle of least privilege.
- **Documentation:** Membership changes should be documented for audit purposes.
