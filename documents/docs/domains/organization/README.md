# **Organization Domain**

## **Overview**

The Organization domain manages structured groups, their internal hierarchies, and member relationships within the
Tournament Organizer system. It provides comprehensive frameworks for representing businesses, sports federations,
sponsors, educational institutions, and other organizational entities involved in tournament management.

This domain uses a hierarchical approach where organizations contain units, units contain members, and members have
specific roles within their organizational context.

## **Domain Structure**

### **Core Models**

- \*\*\*\*: Structured group entity (business, federation, sponsor) with hierarchical units
- \*\*\*\*: Template for identifying and categorizing participant groups and stakeholders
- **🚨 **BROKEN:** [Unit](../organization/unit/unit.md) 🚨**: Distinct division within an organization

  (department, team, project group)

- **🚨 **BROKEN:** [Member](../organization/unit/member.md) 🚨**: Individual participant with roles within

  organizational context

### **Supporting Models**

- **[Contact Information](../identity/contact_information.md)**: Contact details for organizations and

  units

- \*\*\*\*: Equipment and supplies managed by organizations
- \*\*\*\*: Media associated with organizations

## **Template Entity Analysis**

### **Current Template Entities**

- **Target Audience**: Used as a template for standard audience definitions, referenced by tournaments and rules
- **Role**: Referenced by members for role assignments within organizational contexts

### **Potential Template Entities**

- **Suspended**: Organization is temporarily suspended from participation

### **Target Audience Statuses**

- **Active**: Template is available for use in tournaments and rules
- **Inactive**: Template is deprecated or no longer recommended

### **Unit Statuses**

- **Active**: Unit is operational and functioning
- **Inactive**: Unit is temporarily not operational
- **Archived**: Unit has been decommissioned but records are maintained

### **Member Statuses**

## **Hierarchical Structure**

### **Organization Hierarchy**

- Organizations can contain multiple units

- Roles are context-dependent (organization-specific)
- Role assignments can be updated as organizational needs change
- External context determines role scope and permissions

## **Quality Standards**

- All models include comprehensive attribute documentation
- Cross-references are accurate and up to date
- Status lifecycles are clearly defined
- Template entity usage is documented
- Hierarchical relationships are well-defined
- Practical examples are provided where relevant

- Maintain clear role assignments and permissions
- Support flexible organizational structures and relationships
- Ensure proper access control for organizational data
- Maintain accurate cross-references between all related models
- Regularly review and update documentation for clarity and completeness
