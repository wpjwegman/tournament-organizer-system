# **Organization Domain**

## **Overview**

The Organization domain manages structured groups, their internal hierarchies, and member relationships within the
Tournament Organizer system. It provides comprehensive frameworks for representing businesses, sports federations,
sponsors, educational institutions, and other organizational entities involved in tournament management.

This domain uses a hierarchical approach where organizations contain units, units contain members, and members have
specific roles within their organizational context.

## **Domain Structure**

### **Core Models**

- \*\*\*\*: Structured group entity (business, federation, sponsor) with hierarchical units

  (department, team, project group)

- **ðŸš¨ **BROKEN:** [Member](../organization/unit/member.md) ðŸš¨**: Individual participant with roles within

  organizational context

  units

- Role assignments can be updated as organizational needs change
- External context determines role scope and permissions

## **Quality Standards**

- All models include comprehensive attribute documentation
- Cross-references are accurate and up to date
- Status lifecycles are clearly defined
- Template entity usage is documented
- Hierarchical relationships are well-defined
- Practical examples are provided where relevant
