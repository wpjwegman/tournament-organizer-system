# **Organization** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Introduction**

The **Organization** Entity represents a structured group such as a business, school, sports federation, sponsor, or
supplier involved in the Tournament Organizer ecosystem. It manages key identifying information, contact details (via
reference), and relationships for these entities.

It possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

It inherits properties from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

## **Relationships**

- An `Organization` **Entity** references other **Entities** via ID:

  - Optionally references one `Contact Information` Entity (which contains address, phone, email, media links, etc.).
  - Optionally references multiple `Organizational Unit` Entities representing its internal structure.
  - Optionally references one `Inventory` Entity for managing organization equipment and supplies.

- Other **Entities** reference `Organization`:

  - A `Tournament` may reference an `Organization` as its organizer or sponsor.
  - A `Venue` may reference an `Organization` as its owner or manager.
  - An `Organizational Unit` references its parent `Organization`.
  - A `Member` Entity indicates affiliation via context (e.g., being listed in an `Organizational Unit` belonging to

    this `Organization`).

---

## **Considerations**

- **Uniqueness:** The `Name` attribute should ideally be unique or managed within a relevant scope (e.g., unique among

  top-level organizations).

- **Categorization:** Consistent use of the `Type` attribute facilitates filtering and management. Allowed values

  defined in \*\*\*\*.

- **Contact Details:** All contact methods (address, phone, email, media links) are accessed via the referenced

  `Contact Information` entity.

- **Internal Structure:** The `Units` attribute allows modelling hierarchical structures within the organization.
- **Status Workflow:** Define clear processes for `Status` transitions (e.g., Active, Inactive, Pending Verification).
- **Inventory Management:** The organization's inventory should be managed in coordination with tournament and venue

  inventories to ensure proper resource allocation and tracking.
