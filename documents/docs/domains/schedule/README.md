# Schedule Domain

## Overview

The Schedule domain manages the organization, timing, and execution of all tournament events and competitions. It  
provides a comprehensive framework for scheduling fixtures, managing matches, tracking scores and events, and  
coordinating officials across all tournament activities.

This domain ensures proper resource allocation, timing coordination, and event progression tracking while maintaining  
flexibility for different tournament formats and requirements.

## Domain Structure

### Core Models

- **[Schedule](schedule.md)**: Container for organizing and managing collections of fixtures
- **[Fixture](fixture.md)**: Specific scheduled competition instances with time, location, and operational details
- **[Match](match.md)**: Competitive encounters between teams
- **[Timeslot](timeslot.md)**: Value object for specific time intervals (start/end times)
- **[Event](event.md)**: Records specific occurrences during matches (penalties, warnings, substitutions)
- **[Score](score.md)**: Value object for team scores in fixtures with progression tracking

### Supporting Models

- **[Official](official/official.md)**: Individuals acting in official capacities (referees, judges, umpires)
- **[Qualification](official/qualification.md)**: Official certifications and qualifications

## Template Entity Analysis

### Current Template Entities

- **Schedule**: Can be templated for standard schedule types (main, practice, stage-specific)
- **Fixture**: Can be templated for standard fixture configurations
- **Official**: Can be templated for standard official roles and qualifications

### Potential Template Entities

- **Timeslot Templates**: Standard time intervals for different sports/activities
- **Event Templates**: Standard event types and descriptions
- **Score Templates**: Standard scoring formats for different sports

**Key Capabilities:**

- Team participation and competitive arrangement management
- Multiple match format support from individual to team-based encounters
- Score tracking, result determination, and competition progression
- Competition analysis and performance evaluation

### Temporal and Event Models

#### [Timeslot](timeslot.md) - Value Object

Precise temporal intervals with defined boundaries that enable scheduling coordination, conflict detection,  
and resource optimization across tournament activities.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Timezone-aware scheduling for international tournaments
- Complex scheduling coordination with conflict detection
- Resource allocation optimization across temporal constraints
- Immutable temporal records for audit trails

#### [Event](event.md) - Entity

Significant occurrences during competitive activities with detailed incident tracking, temporal documentation,  
and comprehensive analysis capabilities for tournament management.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Real-time event tracking and post-competition analysis
- Disciplinary action tracking and official decision documentation
- Performance analysis and statistical reporting
- Audit trails for competitive integrity and dispute resolution

## Status Lifecycle

### Schedule Statuses

- **Draft**: Schedule is being created/configured
- **Published**: Schedule is available for viewing
- **Active**: Schedule is currently in use
- **Completed**: All fixtures in schedule are finished

### Fixture Statuses

- **Scheduled**: Fixture is planned but not confirmed
- **Confirmed**: Fixture is confirmed and ready
- **In Progress**: Fixture is currently running
- **Completed**: Fixture has finished
- **Cancelled**: Fixture was cancelled
- **Postponed**: Fixture was postponed

### Match Statuses

- **Scheduled**: Match is planned
- **In Progress**: Match is currently running
- **Completed**: Match has finished
- **Cancelled**: Match was cancelled

### Event Statuses

- **Recorded**: Event has been recorded
- **Reviewed**: Event has been reviewed
- **Overturned**: Event was overturned/changed

### Official Statuses

- **Active**: Official is available for assignments
- **Inactive**: Official is not available
- **Pending**: Official status is being reviewed

### Lifecycle Transitions

- Schedule: Draft → Published → Active → Completed
- Fixture: Scheduled → Confirmed → In Progress → Completed/Cancelled/Postponed
- Match: Scheduled → In Progress → Completed/Cancelled
- Event: Recorded → Reviewed → Overturned
- Official: Pending → Active ↔ Inactive

## Relationships & Cross-References

- **Schedule ↔ Fixture**: Groups and organizes fixtures
- **Fixture ↔ Match**: Links scheduled time/location to competitive encounter
- **Fixture ↔ Timeslot**: Defines when the fixture occurs
- **Fixture ↔ Area**: Defines where the fixture occurs
- **Fixture ↔ Official**: Assigns officials to fixtures
- **Fixture ↔ Score**: Tracks scores during the fixture
- **Fixture ↔ Event**: Records events during the fixture
- **Match ↔ Team**: Links teams participating in the match
- **Event ↔ Match/Team**: Records events with context and team
- **Score ↔ Fixture/Team**: Records scores with context and team
- **Official ↔ Human Profile**: Links official to their profile

## Quality Standards

- All models include comprehensive attribute documentation
- Cross-references are accurate and up to date
