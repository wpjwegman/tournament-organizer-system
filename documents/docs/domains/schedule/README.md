## Business Rules and Constraints

### Scheduling Constraints

- Fixtures cannot overlap in the same venue area without explicit multi-use configuration
- Officials cannot be assigned to concurrent fixtures requiring their exclusive attention
- Teams cannot participate in overlapping competitive activities
- Equipment and resource availability must be verified before fixture confirmation

### Status Transitions

**Schedule Lifecycle:**
`DRAFT` → `PUBLISHED` → `ACTIVE` → `COMPLETED`

**Fixture Lifecycle:**
`SCHEDULED` → `READY` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` | `POSTPONED` | `CANCELLED`

**Match Lifecycle:**
`SCHEDULED` → `READY` → `IN_PROGRESS` → `COMPLETED` | `FORFEIT` | `NO_CONTEST`

**Official Lifecycle:**
`PENDING` → `ACTIVE` ↔ `UNAVAILABLE` → `RETIRED`

### Quality Standards

- All temporal boundaries must be chronologically valid and timezone-consistent
- Official qualifications must be current and appropriate for assigned competition levels
- Score records must be verified by authorized personnel before final recording
- Event documentation requires sufficient detail for audit and dispute resolution

## Integration Points

### External Domain Dependencies

- **Tournament Domain:** Tournament structure and competitive framework
- **Team Domain:** Team participation and competitive eligibility
- **Venue Domain:** Physical location availability and resource constraints
- **Identity Domain:** Individual identity management for officials and participants
- **Organization Domain:** Certification bodies and tournament organizing entities

### Data Flow Patterns

- **Schedule Creation:** Tournament requirements → Schedule planning → Fixture allocation → Resource coordination
- **Match Execution:** Fixture activation → Match progression → Event recording → Score tracking → Result finalization
- **Official Assignment:** Qualification verification → Availability checking → Assignment matching → Performance tracking
