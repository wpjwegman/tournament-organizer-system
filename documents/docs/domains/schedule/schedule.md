# Schedule (Entity)

## Overview

The Schedule Entity acts as a container for organizing and managing a collection of Fixture entities within a  
tournament or event context. It provides the overall timing structure and coordination for all scheduled activities.

As an Entity, it possesses a unique identity and lifecycle, managed according to the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

## Structure

This entity includes standard attributes from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md)  
and adds the following schedule-specific attributes:

| Attribute | Description | Type | Required | Notes / Example |
|-----------|-------------|------|----------|-----------------|
| **Tournament** | Reference to the tournament this schedule belongs to | UUID | Yes | `tournament-uuid-123` |
| **Start Date** | The date when the schedule begins | Date | Yes | `2024-11-02` |
| **End Date** | The date when the schedule ends | Date | Yes | `2024-11-10` |
| **Fixtures** | List of fixtures that make up this schedule | List[Fixture] | Yes | Embedded list of scheduled matches and events |
| **Notes** | Additional notes about the schedule | Text | Optional | `"Schedule subject to weather conditions"` |

## Relationships

## Considerations
