# Timeslot (Value Object)

## Overview

A Timeslot represents a specific temporal interval with defined start and end boundaries, providing precise time  
allocation for tournament activities. As a value object without independent identity, it offers immutable temporal  
data that enables comprehensive scheduling coordination, conflict detection, and resource optimization.

## Purpose

This value object enables comprehensive temporal management by:

- Defining precise time boundaries for tournament activities and competitive events
- Supporting complex scheduling coordination with conflict detection and resolution
- Facilitating resource allocation optimization across temporal constraints
- Enabling timezone-aware scheduling for international and multi-regional tournaments
- Providing immutable temporal records for audit trails and schedule verification

## Examples

### Example: Championship Final Timeslot

```mermaid
graph TD
  T[Timeslot: Championship Final]
  T --> ST[Start: 2024-11-17T19:00:00Z]
  T --> ET[End: 2024-11-17T21:30:00Z]
  T --> D[Duration: 150 minutes]
  T --> TZ[Timezone: America/New_York]
  T --> TZO[Offset: -05:00]
  T --> LST[Local Start: 14:00 EST]
  T --> LET[Local End: 16:30 EST]
  T --> DS[Daylight Saving: false]
  T --> BB[Buffer Before: 60 minutes]
  T --> BA[Buffer After: 45 minutes]
  T --> ES[Effective Start: 18:00:00Z]
  T --> EE[Effective End: 22:15:00Z]
  T --> PL[Priority: CRITICAL]
  T --> F[Flexibility: 0 minutes]
  T --> RP[Recurrence: None]
  T --> VC[Venue: Main arena operating hours]
  T --> EQS[Setup: 45 minutes for broadcast]
  T --> EQB[Breakdown: 30 minutes]
  T --> VS[Status: VALID]
```

This example demonstrates a high-priority championship timeslot with comprehensive temporal coordination  
including broadcast setup, venue constraints, and zero flexibility typical of major tournament finals.

### Example: Qualifying Round Timeslot

```mermaid
graph TD
  T[Timeslot: Qualifying Match Q024]
  T --> ST[Start: 2024-10-28T15:30:00Z]
  T --> ET[End: 2024-10-28T16:30:00Z]
  T --> D[Duration: 60 minutes]
  T --> TZ[Timezone: UTC]
  T --> TZO[Offset: +00:00]
  T --> LST[Local Start: 15:30 UTC]
  T --> LET[Local End: 16:30 UTC]
  T --> DS[Daylight Saving: N/A]
  T --> BB[Buffer Before: 10 minutes]
  T --> BA[Buffer After: 10 minutes]
  T --> ES[Effective Start: 15:20:00Z]
  T --> EE[Effective End: 16:40:00Z]
  T --> PL[Priority: MEDIUM]
  T --> F[Flexibility: 15 minutes]
  T --> RP[Recurrence: None]
  T --> VC[Venue: Standard court hours]
  T --> EQS[Setup: 5 minutes]
  T --> EQB[Breakdown: 5 minutes]
  T --> VS[Status: VALID]
```

This second example shows a flexible qualifying timeslot with standard buffer periods and moderate  
priority suitable for preliminary tournament rounds with scheduling adaptability.

## Value Object Characteristics

### Immutability

- Timeslot boundaries cannot be modified once established; changes require new timeslot creation
- All temporal attributes remain constant throughout the value object lifecycle
- Timezone information maintains consistency to prevent temporal calculation errors
- Buffer and setup times become fixed once allocated to prevent scheduling conflicts

### Temporal Validation

- End time must be chronologically after start time
- Duration must match the calculated difference between start and end times
- Timezone offsets must be valid and consistent with specified timezone
- Buffer periods cannot exceed reasonable limits or create negative effective durations

### Scheduling Constraints

- Overlapping timeslots require explicit conflict resolution procedures
- Resource availability must be verified within effective time boundaries
- Priority levels determine conflict resolution precedence
- Flexibility windows enable dynamic scheduling adjustments

## Temporal Operations

### Duration Calculations

```text
Duration = End Time - Start Time
Effective Duration = Effective End - Effective Start
Total Allocation = Duration + Buffer Before + Buffer After + Setup + Breakdown
```

### Timezone Conversions

```text
UTC Time = Local Time + Timezone Offset
Local Time = UTC Time - Timezone Offset
```

### Conflict Detection

```text
Overlap = (Start1 < End2) AND (Start2 < End1)
Resource Conflict = Same Resource AND Overlap
Schedule Conflict = Same Entity AND Overlap
```

## Business Rules

### Temporal Constraints

- Timeslots cannot have negative durations or invalid temporal boundaries
- Resource allocation must respect venue operating hours and availability
- Equipment setup and breakdown time must be included in effective timeslot boundaries
- Buffer periods provide transition time between consecutive activities

### Conflict Resolution

- Higher priority timeslots take precedence in resource allocation conflicts
- Flexibility windows enable automatic rescheduling within acceptable parameters
- Critical priority timeslots cannot be moved or modified without explicit authorization
- Conflict resolution must maintain tournament integrity and fairness

### Timezone Management

- All timeslots stored in UTC for consistency and calculation accuracy
- Local timezone display provided for user convenience and regional coordination
- Daylight saving transitions handled automatically with appropriate offset adjustments
- International tournaments require careful timezone coordination across regions
