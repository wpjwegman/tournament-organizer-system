# **Ranking** (Data Model - Template Entity)

## **Description**

An entity representing a calculated position for a team within a tournament's ranking list. Rankings are used to
evaluate performance, determine seeding, track progress, and provide a basis for awards. Standings
([Standing](../standing/standing.md)) typically represent positions within intermediate stages like groups
or poules.

## **Relationships**

- **Team:** The `Team` attribute links to a specific [Team](../team/team.md).
- Rankings are often derived from or final [Standings](../standing/standing.md) calculated via a .
- This Ranking is embedded within a [Tournament](../tournament/tournament.md), which provides the context

  and scope for the ranking list.

## **Considerations**

- **Seeding Usage:** Rankings are primarily used for tournament seeding and initial team placement.
- **Historical Tracking:** The system maintains historical ranking records to track team performance over time. The

  status field from the base entity model is used to indicate if a ranking is current or historical.

- **Discipline Context:** Rankings may be discipline-specific or cross-discipline depending on the tournament type.
- **Update Frequency:** Rankings are typically updated periodically, not in real-time.
