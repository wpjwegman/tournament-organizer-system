# Ranking Domain

## Overview

The Ranking Domain handles the pre-tournament ranking systems used for tournament seeding and initial team placement.
This domain focuses on calculating and maintaining team rankings that serve as the foundation for tournament seeding
decisions.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of the Ranking Domain is to provide a fair and accurate basis for tournament seeding by:

- Maintaining historical performance records
- Calculating team rankings across different time periods
- Supporting discipline-specific ranking systems
- Enabling cross-discipline ranking normalization
- Providing the foundation for tournament seeding decisions

## Current Models

### Ranking

The core model for storing team rankings. See [Ranking Model](../ranking/ranking.md) for detailed
documentation.

Key aspects:

- Stores team ranking positions
- Tracks ranking points
- Maintains ranking history
- Links to teams and disciplines
- Supports ranking period management
- Enables seeding system integration

## Domain Scope

### In Scope
