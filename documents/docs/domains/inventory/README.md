# Inventory Domain

## Overview

The Inventory domain manages the tracking, allocation, and availability of physical equipment, supplies, and
resources needed for tournament operations. This domain provides comprehensive inventory management capabilities
including item definitions, stock records, and inventory groupings by organizational context.

## Purpose

This domain enables tournament organizers to:

- Track equipment and supplies across multiple tournaments and venues
- Manage stock levels and availability for planning purposes
- Organize inventory by context (tournament, venue, fixture)
- Monitor item reservations and allocations
- Ensure adequate resources are available for events

## Structure

The inventory domain consists of the following models:

| Model | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| [Inventory](inventory.md) | Template Entity | Groups and manages collections of items by organizational context |
| [Item](item.md) | Template Entity | Defines equipment, supplies, and resources with tracking capabilities |
| [Stock Record](stock_record.md) | Value Object | Embedded tracking data within items for quantity management |

All template entities include standard attributes from the [Base Entity](../foundation/base_entity.md).

## Example

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Tournament Inventory] --> B[Match Balls: 20 available]
    A --> C[Field Cones: 50 available]
    A --> D[Referee Equipment: 10 sets]
    
    E[Venue Inventory] --> F[Sound System: 2 units]
    E --> G[Tables: 15 available]
    E --> H[Chairs: 100 available]
    
    I[Safety Inventory] --> J[First Aid Kits: 5 kits]
    I --> K[Emergency Equipment: 3 sets]
```

This example shows how inventories organize different categories of items by their operational context. Tournament
inventories focus on competition equipment, venue inventories manage facility resources, and safety inventories
ensure emergency preparedness. Each item tracks quantities and availability to support planning and allocation
decisions.
