# GitHub Actions Workflow Issues Analysis

## üö® Issue Summary

After completing the scripts modernization (Issue #18), several GitHub Actions workflows need to be updated to work
with the new container validation system and modernized scripts structure.

## üîç Identified Problems

### 1. **Container Workflow Issues** (`containerized-docs-quality.yml`)

- **Problem**: References old `docker compose` commands that may not align with current Containerfile
- **Impact**: Container-based validation may fail in CI
- **Priority**: HIGH (affects container-first validation strategy)

### 2. **Path References** (Multiple workflows)

- **Problem**: Workflows may reference old script paths after reorganization
- **Files Affected**: `ci.yml`, `documentation-quality.yml`, `quality-reports.yml`
- **Impact**: Scripts may not be found during CI execution
- **Priority**: HIGH

### 3. **Dependency Management**

- **Problem**: Workflows may use old dependency installation methods
- **Impact**: May not install modern uv-based dependencies correctly
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 4. **Quality Check Integration**

- **Problem**: Workflows may not integrate with new quality dashboard system
- **Impact**: Missing comprehensive quality reporting in CI
- **Priority**: MEDIUM

### 5. **Container Environment Variables**

- **Problem**: Container workflows may need environment updates for new validation system
- **Impact**: Container validation may fail with permission or path issues
- **Priority**: HIGH

## üéØ Required Fixes

### Phase 1: Critical Container Issues

1. Update `containerized-docs-quality.yml` to use new container validation system
2. Fix path references to modernized scripts
3. Ensure container permission handling works in CI environment

### Phase 2: Integration Updates

1. Update all workflows to use new quality dashboard system
2. Integrate with modern uv dependency management
3. Update artifact collection for new report locations

### Phase 3: Optimization

1. Optimize workflow triggers for better performance
2. Add comprehensive error reporting
3. Ensure consistency across all workflows

## üîß Technical Requirements

- All workflows must work with container-first approach
- Integration with modern uv package management
- Proper artifact collection from new script locations
- Maintain security and quality standards

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

- [ ] All GitHub Actions workflows run successfully
- [ ] Container validation works in CI environment
- [ ] Quality reports are properly generated and collected
- [ ] No path or dependency resolution errors
- [ ] Workflows complete within reasonable time limits

## üöÄ Implementation Plan

1. Create feature branch for GitHub Actions fixes
2. Update container workflows first (highest priority)
3. Fix path references across all workflows
4. Test workflows with sample PR
5. Document any CI-specific configuration needed
6. Merge when all workflows pass successfully
